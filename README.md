Hello! This is my first real attempt at OpenGL 3 and C++\
Custom math and logging library

Hoping to make an actual game in the future!

## Resources used to learn:
+ [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/) is great for getting into 3D
+ [RXI's log.c](https://github.com/rxi/log.c) was very helpful for creating my logger, and a nice introduction to variadic functions in C++
+ [Paul Bourke's article on marching cubes](http://www.paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/) was a great resource to learn marching cubes!
+ [PolyVox's](http://www.volumesoffun.com/polyvox-about/index.html) alternative MC tables allow bitwise arithmetic which helped for implementing EBOs
+ and last but not least, [The Cherno's OpenGL series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) is a great visual/auditory explanation for the basics of OpenGL!

## External libraries used:
+ [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
+ [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
+ [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

This project has only been tested on MacOS, although I reckon if it works on here, it probably works on Windows / Linux :P

All my code is icensed under The Unlicense as of now, however due credit would always be kind :)
